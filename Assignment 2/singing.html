        <h1>Singing</h1>
        <p>I love to sing. Music is my escape.Singing has always been one of my greatest passions. From a young age, I have been enchanted by the power of music and its ability to express emotions and tell stories. Whether I'm singing classical pieces, contemporary songs, or anything in between, I find immense joy in exploring different genres and pushing my vocal limits. Singing allows me to express myself creatively and provides a therapeutic escape from the stresses of daily life. Being a part of the musical community at IITB has enriched my experience, giving me opportunities to perform and collaborate with other talented musicians. Music brings a sense of fulfillment and happiness to my life, whether I'm performing solo or harmonizing with a group. </p>
